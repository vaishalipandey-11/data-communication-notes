## 📌 1. Analog vs. Digital Signals

| Feature        | Analog Signal        | Digital Signal         |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Nature         | Continuous            | Discrete (0 and 1)       |
| Examples       | Human voice, light    | Computer data, files     |
| Use Cases      | AM/FM radio           | Internet, networking     |
| Visual         | Sine wave             | Square pulse             |

> ✅ Digital signals are more reliable in transmission: less noise, easy regeneration, encryption.

## 📌 2. Signal Characteristics

| Term         | Definition                  | Unit / Formula              |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Amplitude    | Strength of signal           | Volts                       |
| Frequency (f)| Cycles per second            | Hz → \( f = \frac{1}{T} \)  |
| Period (T)   | Duration of one cycle        | Seconds → \( T = \frac{1}{f} \) |
| Phase        | Timing of wave               | Degrees (°)                 |
| Wavelength (λ)| Signal distance per cycle   | \( \lambda = \frac{v}{f} \) |

## 📌 3. Composite Signals & Bandwidth

- Non-sinusoidal signals are a mix of sine waves → Fourier analysis
- **Bandwidth (Hz)** = Range of frequencies \( f_{\text{high}} - f_{\text{low}} \)

---

## 📌 4. Digital Concepts

| Concept        | Explanation                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Bit Rate       | Bits per second (bps) = \( \frac{\text{bits}}{\text{second}} \) |
| Bit Interval   | Time for one bit = \( \frac{1}{\text{bit rate}} \) |
| Baud Rate      | Number of signal changes per second |
| Line Coding    | Converts digital bits to signal     |

> ⚠️ Bit rate ≠ Baud rate always. Bit rate = Baud rate × bits per signal.

## 📌 5. Transmission Impairments

| Impairment     | Description                          | Example                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Attenuation    | Signal strength decreases             | Long cable distances   |
| Distortion     | Signal components arrive unequally    | Voice delay on calls   |
| Noise          | Unwanted signals                      | Crosstalk, thermal     |

> 🔁 Use repeaters to fight attenuation and remove noise.

## 📌 6. Theoretical Data Rate Formulas

### ✅ Nyquist Bit Rate (No noise)
\[
\text{Max Bit Rate} = 2 × B × \log_2 L
\]
- B = Bandwidth (Hz), L = Number of signal levels

### ✅ Shannon Capacity (With noise)
\[
C = B × \log_2(1 + SNR)
\]
- SNR = Signal-to-noise ratio (pure number)

**Convert SNR from dB to raw**:
\[
\text{SNR} = 10^{(SNR_{dB}/10)}
\]

## 📌 7. Performance Metrics

| Metric         | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Bandwidth      | Capacity of the channel               |
| Throughput     | Actual data rate achieved             |
| Latency        | Total delay in data transmission      |
| Jitter         | Variance in latency (important in VoIP) |

### ⚙️ Latency Components:
\[
\text{Total Latency} = d_{\text{prop}} + d_{\text{trans}} + d_{\text{queue}} + d_{\text{proc}}
\]

| Delay Type            | Formula / Meaning                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Propagation Delay      | \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \) |
| Transmission Delay     | \( \frac{\text{Packet Size}}{\text{Bandwidth}} \) |
| Processing Delay       | Time for route lookup, checking headers |
| Queuing Delay          | Waiting in router queues                |

> - Know when to use **Nyquist** (ideal, noiseless) vs **Shannon** (practical, noisy)
> - Be ready to explain **impairments** and **delay types** with real-world examples.

Impairments (Real-world Examples)
Attenuation: The reduction in signal strength as it travels over a medium.
Example: Signal loss over long-distance telephone lines.
Distortion: The change in signal shape due to the medium's properties.
Example: Audio distortion in old radio signals due to poor quality transmission.
Noise: Unwanted signals that interfere with the main signal.
Example: Static in a phone call caused by electrical interference.
Interference: The superposition of signals from other sources that disrupt the communication.
Example: Wi-Fi interference when multiple routers are operating on the same frequency.

Delay Types (Real-world Examples)
Propagation Delay: Time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver.
Example: Satellite communication has high propagation delay because the signals must travel long distances to space.
Transmission Delay: Time taken to push all the bits of a message into the transmission medium.
Example: Sending a large file over a slow internet connection.
Processing Delay: Time spent processing the signal or packet by routers or devices.
Example: Processing a webpage request in a server, which involves decoding, encryption, etc.
Queueing Delay: Time spent waiting in a buffer or queue before the signal is transmitted.
Example: Delay in video streaming if the network is congested, causing buffering.

🧠 2.5 Addressing (TCP/IP Model)
    In an internet using TCP/IP protocols, four levels of addresses are used:

    Type        	Layer	            Example             	Size
    Physical    	Data Link Layer	    07:01:02:01:2C:4B	    48 bits (Ethernet)
    Logical (IP)	Network Layer	    192.168.1.1	            32 bits (IPv4)
    Port	        Transport Layer	    80, 443, 21	            16 bits
    Specific    	Application Layer	www.google.com, email	Variable (human-friendly)

    1. Physical Address (Link Address)
        Address assigned by NIC hardware.
        Used within a LAN/WAN, not across networks.
        Example: MAC Address in Ethernet (6 bytes / 48 bits): 07:01:02:01:2C:4B
        Changes at each hop in internetwork.

    🧩 Frame Header at Data Link Layer:
        Source physical address
        Destination physical address

    📝 Example:
     Sender with MAC 10 sends frame to receiver with MAC 87. All nodes receive the frame, but only node 87 accepts it.

    2. Logical Address (IP Address)
        Assigned by software (IP layer), used across different networks.
        Universal addressing scheme — independent of underlying hardware.
        Remains the same from source to destination.
        Example: 192.168.0.5

    📝 Used in the IP packet:
        Logical source address
        Logical destination address

    🧩 Routing Use:
        Routers use logical addresses to route packets.
        Each router interface has a different IP address (and physical address).

    3. Port Address
        Identifies a specific process (application) on a host.
        Required for process-to-process communication.
        Length: 16 bits
        Example: HTTP → 80, HTTPS → 443, FTP → 21

    🧩 Used in Transport Layer (TCP/UDP):
        Source port
        Destination port

    📝 Example:
         Port a on sender communicates with port j on receiver (e.g., FTP client/server).

    4. Specific Address (User-Friendly)
        Used by applications.
        Examples:
        Email: vaishali@example.com
        URL: https://www.google.com

    Converted into IP + Port by the application layer.
    🧠 Resolved via DNS or other application protocols.

    1. Physical Address (Link Layer – MAC Address)
    🧑‍💻 Story:
    Alice wants to send a file to Bob on the same local network.
    Her computer has a physical address (MAC) of 10:20:30:40:50:60.
    Bob’s MAC is AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF.
    The frame is sent across the LAN with Bob's MAC in the destination field.
    Only Bob's machine accepts it; others ignore it.
    ✅ Key: Used within a LAN, changes at every hop.

2. Logical Address (Network Layer – IP Address)
    🌐 Story:
    Alice is in India and wants to video call her friend Bob in Canada.
    Her device has the IP address 192.168.1.2, Bob’s has 203.0.113.5.
    Routers use these IP addresses to route the packet across the internet.
    The IP stays the same across all hops.
    ✅ Key: Unique across networks, doesn’t change during transmission.

3. Port Address (Transport Layer – Process Level)
    ⚙️ Story:
    Alice opens her browser and visits www.example.com.
    The browser uses port 12345 (source), and connects to port 80 (destination, HTTP) on the server.
    This ensures the request reaches the correct application on the server.
    ✅ Key: Identifies specific applications/processes on a device.

4. Specific Address (Application Layer – URL or Email)
    📧 Story:
    Alice sends an email to bob@example.com.
    This is a specific address used by humans.
    Behind the scenes, it is translated into an IP and port by DNS and mail protocols.
    ✅ Key: User-friendly address, gets resolved to IP + port.

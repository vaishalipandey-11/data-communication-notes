🔹 Physical Layer – OSI Model (Layer 1)
    📌 Primary Role
       Responsible for transmitting raw bits (0s and 1s) from one node to the next over a physical medium.

    🔧 Key Functions
        Physical Characteristics of Interfaces & Medium
        Specifies hardware (cables, connectors, etc.) and transmission media (wire, fiber, wireless).

    Bit Representation (Encoding)
        Converts bits into signals (electrical/optical).
        Defines encoding schemes like NRZ, Manchester, etc.

    Data Rate
        Defines transmission rate in bits per second (bps).
        Also defines bit duration (how long each bit lasts).

    Bit Synchronization
        Ensures sender and receiver clocks are aligned at the bit level.
        Crucial for accurate data interpretation.

    Line Configuration
        Point-to-Point: Dedicated link between two devices.
        Multipoint: Shared link among multiple devices.

    Physical Topology.

    Transmission Mode
        Simplex: One-way only (e.g., keyboard to CPU).
        Half-Duplex: Two-way, but one at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie).
        Full-Duplex: Two-way, simultaneously (e.g., phone call).

🔹 Data Link Layer – OSI Model (Layer 2)
    📌 Primary Role
     Converts the unreliable bit-oriented physical layer into a reliable frame-oriented link by ensuring error detection, framing, and flow control.

    🔧 Key Responsibilities
    Framing
        Breaks the bit stream from the network layer into frames (data units).
        Adds headers/trailers to clearly mark the frame boundaries.

    Physical Addressing
        Adds the MAC (Media Access Control) address of the sender/receiver to the frame header.
        Ensures correct delivery within the same network (hop-to-hop).

    Flow Control
        Prevents the receiver from being overwhelmed by controlling the rate of data transmission.
        Uses techniques like stop-and-wait and sliding window.

    Error Control
        Ensures error detection and correction (or retransmission).
        Uses checksums, CRC, or parity bits in the trailer.
        Can detect lost/damaged/duplicate frames.

    Access Control
        Determines which device can access the shared link when multiple devices are connected.
        Used in environments like LANs with CSMA/CD, Token Passing, etc.

    🔄 Hop-to-Hop Delivery
        Ensures communication between adjacent nodes (e.g., A ➝ B ➝ E ➝ F).
        Each hop uses new frames with updated source and destination MAC addresses.
        This is not end-to-end delivery (handled by Network Layer).

 🔹 Network Layer – OSI Model (Layer 3)
    📌 Primary Role
     Responsible for source-to-destination delivery of packets across multiple networks (end-to-end delivery).

    🔧 Key Responsibilities
    Logical Addressing
        Adds a logical address (e.g., IP address) to each packet.
        Used for global identification of source and destination.
        Unlike MAC (physical) addresses, logical addresses remain constant across networks.

    Routing
        Determines the best path for a packet to travel from source to destination.
        Uses routing algorithms and routing tables maintained by routers.
        Handles inter-network communication by forwarding packets between independent networks.

    Packet Delivery
        Ensures that packets are delivered from one host to another, possibly through multiple routers.
        Achieves end-to-end communication (unlike Data Link Layer, which is hop-to-hop).

    🔄 Source-to-Destination Delivery
     Involves multiple intermediate routers (e.g., A ➝ B ➝ E ➝ F).

    Each router:
        Reads destination IP in the packet header.
        Uses routing table to decide the next hop.
        Forwards the packet accordingly. 

  🔹 Transport Layer – OSI Model (Layer 4)
    📌 Primary Role
        Responsible for process-to-process delivery of a complete message, ensuring it arrives intact, in order, and without errors.

        🌐 Network Layer → Host-to-host delivery
        ⚙️ Transport Layer → Process-to-process delivery (within hosts)

    🔧 Key Responsibilities
        Service-Point Addressing (Port Addressing)
        Each process on a device is assigned a port number.

        Transport layer uses port numbers to identify the specific sending and receiving processes.
        E.g., HTTP → port 80, HTTPS → port 443

    Segmentation and Reassembly
        Breaks large messages into segments for transmission.
        Adds sequence numbers to help reassemble them correctly at the destination.
        Helps identify missing or out-of-order segments.

    Connection Control
        Can be:
        Connectionless (e.g., UDP): no prior handshake.
        Connection-oriented (e.g., TCP): establishes a connection before data transfer (like a phone call).
        Ensures reliable communication in connection-oriented mode.

    Flow Control
        Manages data rate between source and destination processes.
        Prevents buffer overflow if the receiver is slower than the sender.
        End-to-end flow control (unlike hop-to-hop in Data Link Layer).

    Error Control
        Ensures the entire message is delivered without:Loss, Damage,Duplication
        Achieved via acknowledgment & retransmission.
        Operates end-to-end between processes.      


 🔷 Session Layer (Layer 5) – OSI Model
        📌 Main Role
          Acts as the dialog controller between systems; responsible for establishing, maintaining, and synchronizing sessions between communicating applications.

        🔧 Responsibilities
        Dialog Control
        Manages dialog between two devices.

        Supports:
        Half-duplex: one-way communication at a time.
        Full-duplex: two-way communication simultaneously.

        Synchronization
        Adds checkpoints (sync points) in data stream.
        Helps in resuming transmission after failure without re-sending the entire data.
        Example: Checkpoint every 100 pages while transferring a large file; if crash occurs at page 523, only pages 501–523 need re-sending.

      

🔷 Presentation Layer (Layer 6) – OSI Model
    📌 Main Role
        Handles the syntax and semantics of the data exchanged between applications. Ensures interoperability between different systems.

    🔧 Responsibilities
        Translation
        Converts data between application formats and network formats.
        Ensures compatibility between different data encoding methods (e.g., ASCII ↔ EBCDIC).

        Encryption/Decryption
        Converts plaintext to ciphertext for secure transmission.
        At receiver’s end, decrypts ciphertext back to original data.

        Compression/Decompression
        Reduces data size to improve transmission speed and efficiency.
        Crucial for multimedia data (text, audio, video).

  🌐 Application Layer (Layer 7 of OSI Model)
    🔸 Main Role:
      Provides network services directly to the user (either a human or software).

    🔸 Purpose:
     Helps users interact with the network via apps like email, file transfer, remote login, and directories.

    🔸 Works closely with:
    The Presentation Layer (which handles data formatting, encryption, etc.)

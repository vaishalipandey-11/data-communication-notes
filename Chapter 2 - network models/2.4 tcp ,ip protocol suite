    🧩 TCP/IP Protocol Suite (Internet Protocol Suite)
        🔹 Developed before OSI model
        🔹 Originally had 4 layers, later represented as 5 layers for OSI comparison.

    📊 TCP/IP vs OSI Layer Mapping
        OSI Model	        TCP/IP Model
        Application	        Application
        Presentation        	↘
        Session             	↘
        Transport	        Transport
        Network	            Internet (IP)
        Data Link + Physical	Host-to-Network

    🔸 TCP/IP's Application layer = OSI's Application + Presentation + Session

    ⚙️ TCP/IP Layers and Functions
        1. Host-to-Network (Physical + Data Link)
            Supports standard LAN/WAN protocols (Ethernet, WiFi, etc.)

            No specific protocols defined by TCP/IP here.

        2. Internet Layer
            IP (Internet Protocol): Unreliable, connectionless, best-effort delivery
            → Sends datagrams (can arrive out-of-order or be lost)

            Supporting Protocols:
            ARP: Maps IP address → MAC address
            RARP: Maps MAC address → IP address
            ICMP: Error reporting (e.g., unreachable host, TTL expired)
            IGMP: Manages multicast groups

        3. Transport Layer
            TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
            → Reliable, connection-oriented, uses segments, ensures in-order delivery
            UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
            → Fast, connectionless, minimal error control
            SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
            → Combines best of TCP & UDP, used in VoIP

        4. Application Layer
            Includes all high-level services & protocols:
            HTTP/HTTPS – web
            SMTP/POP3/IMAP – email
            FTP – file transfer
            Telnet/SSH – remote login
            DNS – hostname to IP resolution

    🧠 Modular & Hierarchical: Each protocol can function independently but cooperates with others as needed.

    📌 Definitions You Must Know
        Term	         Definition
        Datagram	    Packet format used by IP; no guarantee of delivery
        Segment	         Data unit at transport layer (TCP)
        Best-effort delivery	IP tries to deliver data but makes no guarantees
        ARP	            Finds MAC address from IP
        RARP	         Finds IP from MAC
        ICMP	        Sends error messages
        IGMP	        Manages group communication
        Port	        Identifies a process on a host (used by TCP/UDP)

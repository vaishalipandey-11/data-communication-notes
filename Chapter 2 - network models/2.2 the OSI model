    📦 OSI Model – 7 Layer Network Architecture
        🔹 Full Form: OSI = Open Systems Interconnection
        🔹 Introduced by: ISO (International Standards Organization) in late 1970s
        🔹 Purpose: To standardize network communication between heterogeneous systems
        🔹 Type: Conceptual model, not a protocol
        🔹 Benefit: Interoperability, modularity, flexibility

    📚 7 Layers of OSI Model (Bottom to Top)
        Layer | Name         | Function (Keyword)                   | Data Unit
            1 | Physical     | Transmission of raw bits             | Bits
            2 | Data Link    | Framing, error detection, MAC        | Frame
            3 | Network      | Routing, logical addressing (IP)     | Packet
            4 | Transport    | End-to-end delivery, segmentation    | Segment
            5 | Session      | Establish/Manage/Terminate sessions  | Data
            6 | Presentation | Encryption, compression, translation | Data
            7 | Application  | User interface, network services     | Data

    🔄 Working Mechanism
        Each layer on the sender side:
            ➤ Adds its own header (H) (and sometimes trailer)
            ➤ Passes it to the layer below
            At receiver:
            ➤ Each layer removes its respective header, processes info, and passes up.
            This process = Encapsulation & De-encapsulation

        🔗 Layer Communication
            Peer-to-peer communication:
            Each layer on device A talks logically to the same layer on device B via a protocol.

            Adjacent layer communication (interface):
            Layers interact directly within the same device using well-defined interfaces.

        🧱 Layer Groups
            Group               | Layers        | Purpose
            Network Support     | 1 – 2 – 3     | Data movement across devices
            User Support        | 5 – 6 – 7     | App-level communication
            Transition Layer    | 4 (Transport) | Links user & network support layers

       ⚙️ Key Concepts
            Encapsulation:  Wrapping data with headers/trailers as it moves down the layers
            Decapsulation: Unwrapping headers/trailers as data moves up the layers
            Only Layers 1–3 are used by intermediate nodes (routers/switches).

        "All People Seem To Need Data Processing"
        Application – Presentation – Session – Transport – Network – Data Link – Physical

    âœ… Network Models
        ðŸ”¹ What is a Network?
            A network = hardware + software that enables data transmission.
            Hardware: Physical equipment (cables, routers).
            Software: Instructions & services (e.g., email, file transfer).

        ðŸ”¹ Layered Approach in Networking
            Used to divide complex networking tasks into manageable layers, like solving a math problem using hardware and software.


       ðŸ”¹ Hierarchy & Order
            Each layer depends on the one below it.
            Tasks follow a strict top-down (send) and bottom-up (receive) order.
            Example: You canâ€™t pick up a letter that hasnâ€™t been dropped in the mailbox.
        
        ðŸ”¹ Services Concept
            Higher layer uses services of the lower layer.
            Each layer performs a specific function and passes data to the next.

        ðŸ”¹ Network Models Overview
            1. OSI Model (Pre-1990)
                7-layer model for standardizing networking.
                Was expected to dominate but never fully implemented.

            2. TCP/IP Model
                Became dominant due to practical use on the Internet.
                Real-world success, unlike theoretical OSI.

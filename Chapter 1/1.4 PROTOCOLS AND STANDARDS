    ðŸ”¹ Protocols
        A protocol = set of rules for communication.
        Defines what, how, and when data is sent.
        Key elements:
        Syntax â€“ structure/format of data
        Semantics â€“ meaning of bits/actions taken
        Timing â€“ when and how fast to send data

    ðŸ”¹ Standards
        Ensure interoperability and fair competition.
        Types:
        De facto â€“ by common use (not officially approved)
        De jure â€“ officially legislated by recognized bodies

    ðŸ”¹ Standards Organizations
        ISO â€“ Global standardization
        ITU-T â€“ Telecommunication standards (part of UN)
        ANSI â€“ U.S. private organization for national standards
        IEEE â€“ Sets computing & networking standards
        EIA â€“ Defines physical and electrical interface standards

    ðŸ”¹ Forums
        Formed by companies to quickly test and adopt new tech.
        Work faster than formal standards committees.

    ðŸ”¹ Regulatory Agencies
        FCC (U.S.) â€“ Regulates communication tech to protect public interest.

    ðŸ”¹ Internet Standards Process
        1. Starts as Internet Draft (6-month valid, no official status)
        2.  Becomes RFC (Request for Comment)
        3.  Passes maturity levels â†’ becomes an Internet Standard

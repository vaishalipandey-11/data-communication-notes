ðŸ“˜ 1.1 Data Communications

ðŸ”¹ Definition

    Data: Information in a form agreed upon by sender and receiver (text, numbers, audio, video, etc.)
    Communication: Sharing of data between devices.
    Local Communication: Happens face-to-face or within short distance (e.g., LAN).
    Remote Communication: Occurs over long distances using a network (e.g., Internet).
    Telecommunication: Communication at a distance (tele = far).

ðŸ”¹ Data Communication

    Exchange of data between two devices via a transmission medium (e.g., cable, wireless).
    Requires a communication system consisting of:
    Hardware (physical devices)
    Software (programs and protocols)

ðŸ”¹ Characteristics of an Effective Data Communication System

    1.Delivery: Data must reach the correct destination.
    2. Accuracy: Data must be delivered without alteration.
    3. Timeliness: Data must be delivered on time.
    4. Especially important in real-time systems (e.g., audio/video).
    5. Jitter: Variability in packet arrival times should be minimal (affects video/audio quality).

ðŸ”¹ Components of Data Communication

    Message: The actual data (text, image, audio, etc.)
    Sender: Device that sends the data (e.g., computer, camera).
    Receiver: Device that receives the data (e.g., monitor, phone).
    Transmission Medium: Path for data (e.g., twisted-pair cable, fiber optics, radio waves).
    Protocol: Set of rules governing communication (e.g., TCP/IP).
       Ensures compatibility and understanding between devices.

ðŸ”¹ Data Representation

    Text:
        Represented as bit patterns.
        Unicode (32-bit): Universal standard supporting all characters/languages.
        ASCII (7-bit): Supports 127 characters, forms part of Unicode (Basic Latin).
    Numbers:
        Directly converted to binary for mathematical operations.
        Not encoded using ASCII.
    Images:
        Represented using pixels.
        Bit pattern assigned per pixel:
        Black & White: 1-bit
        Gray scale: 2+ bits (e.g., 00 = black, 11 = white)
        Color: RGB or YCM models with intensity values encoded.
    Audio:
        Continuous (analog) by nature.
        Converted to analog/digital signals for transmission.
    Video:
        Sequence of images (frames) creating motion.
        Can be continuous (TV feed) or discrete (frame by frame).
        Also converted to analog/digital signals.

ðŸ“˜ Data Flow (Simplex, Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex)
    ðŸ”¹ Simplex
        Unidirectional communication (one-way street).
        Only one device can transmit, the other can only receive.
        Example: Keyboard â†’ Monitor.
        Full channel capacity used in one direction.

    ðŸ”¹ Half-Duplex
        Bidirectional, but not simultaneous (one-way at a time).
        When one device transmits, the other can only receive.
        Example: Walkie-talkies, CB radios.
        Channel capacity shared: only one device transmits at a time.

    ðŸ”¹ Full-Duplex
        Bidirectional communication simultaneously (both devices can transmit/receive at the same time).
        Example: Telephone networks.
        Channel capacity shared: Signals travel in both directions, either with two separate transmission paths or by dividing the channelâ€™s capacity.

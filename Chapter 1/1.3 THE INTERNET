📡 1.3 – The Internet

    🌐 What is the Internet?
        The Internet is a structured, global communication system connecting millions of users and organizations.
        It enables diverse activities: emailing, online shopping, bill payments, reservations, research, etc.

    🧠 Key Terms
        Network: A group of interconnected devices (e.g., computers, printers).
        internet (lowercase): Two or more networks that can communicate.
        Internet (uppercase): The global system of interconnected internets, forming a massive network of networks.

    📜 Brief History of the Internet
        ⚙️ 1960s – The Beginning
        Computers were standalone and incompatible across manufacturers.
        ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) of the U.S. DoD wanted to enable communication between research computers to share results and avoid duplication.

        🧩 1967 – ARPANET Concept
            Proposed at an ACM meeting.
            Each host computer connected to a special device called IMP (Interface Message Processor).
            IMPs would communicate with each other and their respective hosts.

        🧪 1969 – ARPANET Launched
            First four nodes:-> UCLA,  UCSB, SRI (Stanford Research Institute), University of Utah
            Used NCP (Network Control Protocol) to enable communication between hosts.

    🔗 The Birth of TCP/IP
        🧠 1972–73 – Cerf & Kahn's Contributions
            Proposed the Internetting Project.
            Introduced the concept of end-to-end communication using: Encapsulation ,Datagrams, Gateways
            Developed TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable delivery.

        🔄 Splitting TCP into Two Protocols
            TCP – Handles higher-level tasks like segmentation, reassembly, error detection.
            IP (Internet Protocol) – Manages routing of datagrams.
            Together they form the TCP/IP protocol suite, the foundation of the modern Internet.

   🌍 The Internet Today 

    🔹 1. Internet Structure
        Not hierarchical; it's a mesh of global networks.
        Continuously evolving: networks added/removed.
        Mainly private sector-run now (not government).

    🔹 2. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) Hierarchy
        🌐 International ISPs
            Top-level; connect countries together.

        🏢 National ISPs
            Large backbone networks (e.g., SprintLink, UUNet).
            Connected via:
            NAPs (Network Access Points) – public switching stations.
            Peering Points – private, high-speed interconnections (up to 600 Mbps).

        📡 Regional ISPs
            Mid-tier; connect to national ISPs.
            Serve smaller areas with lower data rates.

        🏠 Local ISPs
            Provide direct access to end users.
            May connect to regional or national ISPs.
            Can be companies, universities, or organizations.

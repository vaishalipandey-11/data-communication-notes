üìò 1.2 NETWORKS

üîπ Network

    A network is a collection of devices (nodes) connected by communication links.
    A node can be any device (computer, printer, etc.) capable of sending/receiving data.

üîπ Distributed Processing

    A method where tasks are divided among multiple computers instead of being handled by one big system.
    Each computer (usually a PC or workstation) handles a subset of the overall task.
    Workstation: A high-performance personal computer used for tasks like software development, graphics design, etc., usually connected to a network.

üìò Network Criteria
    ‚úÖ 1. Performance
            Measured by:
            Transit Time: Time for a message to go from sender to receiver.
            Response Time: Time between a request and its response.

            Depends on:
            Number of users,  Type of transmission medium ,Hardware capabilities, Software efficiency

        üìä Key Metrics:
            Throughput: Total data transmitted successfully per second (e.g., Mbps).
            Delay: Time it takes for data to travel from source to destination.
            More throughput often increases delay due to congestion.

    ‚úÖ 2. Reliability
        Refers to accuracy and consistency of data delivery.
        Measured by:
        Failure rate
        Recovery time after failure
        Robustness during disasters

    ‚úÖ 3. Security
        Involves protecting:
        Data from unauthorized access
        Data from corruption or loss
        Recovery from breaches

üìò Physical Structures
    üîπ Link: A communication pathway that transfers data between two devices.

    üîπ Type of Connection ->

    üî∏ Point-to-Point

        A dedicated link between two devices.                                                                        
        Full capacity is used only by those two.
        Examples:  Infrared remote to TV,Microwave or satellite links

            Sender                 Receiver       (or vice versa)
              


    üî∏ Multipoint (Multidrop)

        A shared link among more than two devices.
        Sharing can be:
        Spatially: All use link at once.
        Temporally: Devices take turns using the link.

üîó Physical Topology
   The physical topology defines how devices are physically connected in a network. It shows the layout of cables and nodes.

üìå Types of Physical Topologies
        1. Mesh Topology
         Every node connects to every other node directly.
         Uses dedicated point-to-point links.
         Number of links = n(n - 1)/2, where n = number of nodes.

            Pros:
            High reliability (one link failure doesn‚Äôt affect others)
            Excellent fault isolation
            High security & privacy

            Cons:
            Expensive due to many cables & ports
            Difficult to install and manage

           Use case: WAN backbones, telecom core networks

       2. Star topology

        All devices connect to a central hub/switch,Communication goes via the hub only.

        Pros:
        Easy to install & manage
        Fault isolation is simple
        Scalable (just plug into hub)
        Cons:
        Hub is a single point of failure
        More cable than ring or bus

        ‚úÖ Use case: Common in LANs (office, home setups)

        3. Bus Topology

        All nodes share a single central backbone cable.
        Devices connect via drop lines and taps.

        Pros:
        Cheap & easy to install
        Less cabling needed
        Cons:
        Difficult fault detection
        Break in backbone = network down
        Limited cable length and number of devices

        ‚úÖ Use case: Early Ethernet LANs (now outdated)

        4. Ring Topology

        Each device connects to two neighbors (forms a ring).
        Data travels in one direction (can be bidirectional with dual ring).

        Pros:
        Easy to install
        Each node acts as a repeater
        Fault isolation is easier
        Cons:
        A single node failure can crash the network
        Hard to troubleshoot

        ‚úÖ Use case: Token Ring networks, SONET

        5. Hybrid Topology

        A combination of two or more topologies.
        E.g., Star backbone with bus branches.

        Pros:
        Flexible and scalable
        Customized as per needs
        Cons:
        Complex design and costly

        ‚úÖ Use case: Modern enterprise networks
      
            {       Repeater = Device to amplify/regenerate signal ,      Drop Line = Cable from device to backbone  ,
                    Tap = Connector that links drop line to backbone  ,   Hub = Central connection point   ,           Robust = Can handle failures       
                    I/O Ports = Input/Output hardware interfaces  ,       Spatially Shared = Simultaneous use   ,      Time Shared = One at a time
            }

         üß† Network Models


        Why? -> To standardize communication between different systems (heterogeneous = diverse).

        Models:
        OSI: 7 layers (reference model).
        Internet (TCP/IP): 5 layers (practical)

📘 1.2 NETWORKS

🔹 Network

    A network is a collection of devices (nodes) connected by communication links.
    A node can be any device (computer, printer, etc.) capable of sending/receiving data.

🔹 Distributed Processing

    A method where tasks are divided among multiple computers instead of being handled by one big system.
    Each computer (usually a PC or workstation) handles a subset of the overall task.
    Workstation: A high-performance personal computer used for tasks like software development, graphics design, etc., usually connected to a network.

📘 Network Criteria
    ✅ 1. Performance
            Measured by:
            Transit Time: Time for a message to go from sender to receiver.
            Response Time: Time between a request and its response.

            Depends on:
            Number of users,  Type of transmission medium ,Hardware capabilities, Software efficiency

        📊 Key Metrics:
            Throughput: Total data transmitted successfully per second (e.g., Mbps).
            Delay: Time it takes for data to travel from source to destination.
            More throughput often increases delay due to congestion.

    ✅ 2. Reliability
        Refers to accuracy and consistency of data delivery.
        Measured by:
        Failure rate
        Recovery time after failure
        Robustness during disasters

    ✅ 3. Security
        Involves protecting:
        Data from unauthorized access
        Data from corruption or loss
        Recovery from breaches

📘 Physical Structures
    🔹 Link: A communication pathway that transfers data between two devices.

    🔹 Type of Connection ->

    🔸 Point-to-Point

        A dedicated link between two devices.
        Full capacity is used only by those two.
        Examples:  Infrared remote to TV,Microwave or satellite links
        
        [Device A] ────────────── [Device B]
                ↑                        ↑
            Sender                 Receiver
                (or vice versa)


    🔸 Multipoint (Multidrop)

        A shared link among more than two devices.
        Sharing can be:
        Spatially: All use link at once.
        Temporally: Devices take turns using the link.

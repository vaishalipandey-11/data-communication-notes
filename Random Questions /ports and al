🔌 What is a Port?
    A port is a virtual number (0–65535) used to identify specific applications or services on a device in a network.

    Think of it as a door number on your computer, while the IP address is the street address.

🌐 Why Ports Are Needed:
    Your computer runs many apps (browser, server, email, etc.) — ports help send data to the right one.

    Without ports, the system won’t know which app to deliver network data to.
